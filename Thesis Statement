The Rhino Keyboard is meant to be a new way of interacting with rhino for CAD designers that is more engaging than a mouse and keyboard. 
This can lead to new ways to use rhino as you can design something while staying active, creating a visual both on your screen, and in the real world. 
By creating a ergonomic handheld device, Rhino Keyboard allows the user to get closer to the digital experience.
